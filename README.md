# Shell basics
In Linux, process automation relies heavily on shell scripting. This involves creating a file containing a series of commands that can be executed together. A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line. It allows you to perform a series of actions, such as navigating to a specific directory, creating a folder, and launching a process using the command line.

By saving these commands in a script, you can repeat the same sequence of steps multiple times and execute them by running the script.
The term "shell" refers to a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is one of the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells and is the default shell in many Linux distributions.
This repository contains projects on shell scripting, they include:
* [0x00-shell_basics](https://github.com/jed212/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x00-shell_basics)
* [0x01-shell_permissions](https://github.com/jed212/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x01-shell_permissions)
    * File permissions control which actions can be performed by which users. Read, Write, and Execute are the three actions possible for every file
* [0x02-shell_redirections](https://github.com/jed212/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x02-shell_redirections)
    * Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell. Redirection allows commandsâ€™ file handles to
      be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to.
* [0x03-shell_variables_expansions](https://github.com/jed212/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
    * Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated.
* [command_line_for_the_win](https://github.com/jed212/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/command_line_for_the_win)
